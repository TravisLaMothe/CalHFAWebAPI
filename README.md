# CSC-131 CalHFA Web API Project

 

## Description

The project aim is to create a web API to automate the process of updating and displaying loan information analytics with a variety of different calls. The goal is to free the marketing team of the responsibility of manually maintaining loan information on the agency’s public facing website. The API will be accessed by community users where they will get access to information like financial data. The program will update itself with new data every 2 weeks from a hosted server.
